# xfurio-theme
A simple fork of furio theme tailored to my preference.

Inspired by [furio-theme by hectorpalmatellez](https://github.com/hectorpalmatellez/furio-theme). This theme aims to stay minimalistic and creative with the use of emoji.

To use simply download **xfurio.zsh-theme** and place it to your zsh customs folder *(default ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/)*.
